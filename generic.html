							<p>At Starlings Cafe, I managed the social media accounts while working as a waitress. I took and edited all the images for our social media platforms, ensuring they captured the vibe of the cafe. I also maintained a weekly content calendar, making sure our posts were consistent and engaging. Balancing these tasks in a fast-paced environment required quick thinking and multitasking, but I enjoyed the challenge and made sure every customer received great service.</p>
